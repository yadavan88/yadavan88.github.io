### Coursier Cheatsheets ###

Coursier is a very useful tool for any Scala Developers. From installing JVMs and REPLs to identifying the transitive dependencies of libraries, I use it very often.
You can find the [cheatsheet](https://github.com/yadavan88/coursier-cheatsheets) for coursier commands.

### How to use Alpakka?

Alpakka is a very powerful akka based integration library. It is competing against Apache Camel. [Here](https://github.com/yadavan88/alpakka-mongo-sample) is a sample implmentation of Alpakka with MongoDB connector.
