## Articles and Scala Experiments

### Coursier Cheatsheets

Coursier is a very useful tool for any Scala Developers. From installing JVMs and REPLs to identifying the transitive dependencies of libraries, I use it very often.
You can find the [cheatsheet](https://github.com/yadavan88/coursier-cheatsheets) for coursier commands. 

### Opaque Type Alias

A sample usage of the newly introduced [Opaque Type Alias](https://github.com/yadavan88/opaque-type-sample) in Scala 3.

### Different ways to package Scala Apps

There are many ways in which we can package our simple scala applications. A few of the common and useful packaging tools are described [here](https://github.com/yadavan88/scala-app-packaging-methods).

### How to use Alpakka?

Alpakka is a very powerful akka stream based integration library. It is competing against Apache Camel. [Here](https://github.com/yadavan88/alpakka-mongo-sample) is a sample implmentation of Alpakka with MongoDB connector. 

### Inline Modifier in Scala-3

Scala-3 has completely redesigned macros. It has introduced a new modifier _inline_ to cover a lot of macro cases without actually writing macro. It optimises the code at compile time. More detailed usecases of [inline modifier is available here](https://www.baeldung.com/scala/inline-modifier).

### Enumeratum: Better enum library for Scala 2

Enumerations are one of the most common features in any programming language. However, the in-built enum in Scala standard library has a lot of problems and many programmers avoid using it. We can use another library to overcome the issues in the standard library, and it is called **Enumeratum**. More details and sample usages on how we can use Enumeratum can be read [here](https://github.com/yadavan88/enumeratum-blog)
